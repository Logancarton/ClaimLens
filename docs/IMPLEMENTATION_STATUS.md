# Implementation Status

## Current work state

- **Current phase:** Phase 1 — Evidence extraction baseline.
- **Current gate:** Gate 1 — Evidence extraction baseline.
- **Gate 0 status:** **SATISFIED** — Phase 0 specification freeze completed 2026-08-13.
- **Gate 1 status:** **NOT SATISFIED**.
- **Active phase issue:** GitHub Issue #2.
- **Initial benchmark scope:** frozen; see `docs/BILLING_SCOPE.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- **Initial provider scope:** PMHNP/NP and psychiatrist are distinct benchmark provider classes.
- **Workflow scope:** both `PRE_SIGN` and `PRE_SUBMIT`.
- **Minimum v0.1 evidence schema:** frozen for Phase 1 in `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`.
- **Allowed work:** Phase 1 encounter/evidence implementation, synthetic development cases, focused tests, and baseline extraction measurement.
- **Blocked work:** later-phase runtime work until its release gate is reached.

This file is the single repository source of truth for the **current phase/gate and actual component maturity**. `docs/RELEASE_GATES.md` defines advancement requirements. GitHub issues are the work queue but do not override this state.

Status vocabulary: **Not Started → Designed → Built → Integrated → Verified**.

A component is not Verified because code exists. Verification requires explicit behavioral evidence.
